# Code refactor
This bootcamp project's purpose was to refactor a webpage so that the links are functional, CSS selectors/properties are consolidated and sematic and to optimize the code for search engines.


## Description
Given the code to a website, I was tasked with different ways to refactor the website. Some examples were: 
1. Make CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure
2. Make CSS file is properly commented
3. Make application's links all function correctly
4. Make repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions
5. Make repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc
   

## Usage
No functionally purpose, just for testing
